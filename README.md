Rust Code Translator
This is a Rust program that translates code written in a custom PHP-like language into other programming languages. The program includes a lexer and parser for the source code and provides translation functionality for two target languages: Python 3 and x86_64 assembly for Linux using FASM.

Usage
Compilation
You can compile the Rust code using Cargo, Rust's package manager and build tool:

bash
Copy code
cargo build --release
This command will create an executable file in the target/release directory.

Running
You can run the program with the following command:

bash
Copy code
./target/release/rust_code_translator [OPTIONS] <input.c>
Replace <input.c> with the path to the input code file.

Options
-target <target>: Specify the compilation target. Use python3 for Python 3 translation or fasm-x86_64-linux for x86_64 assembly for Linux. Default is python3.
-help: Print the usage message.
Example
Translate code in input.c to Python 3:

bash
Copy code
./target/release/rust_code_translator -target python3 input.c
Supported Targets
Python 3: Translates the code into Python 3, providing similar functionality.

x86_64 Assembly for Linux (FASM): Translates the code into x86_64 assembly for Linux using the Flat Assembler (FASM). The generated assembly code can be assembled and linked with FASM to create an executable.

Language Features
The input code language is a custom PHP-like language with basic functionality for defining functions, calling functions, and handling string literals, numbers, and simple control flow statements.
